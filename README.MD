# Fiosa
## Fully Integrated Operating System Assistant

Fiosa is an AI chatbot built on top of ChatGPT's API. It has full integration into your Ubuntu system, and has access to the terminal and can control your computer to help you do tasks if you are lazy or don't know how to do them yourself.
*NOTE: I am not responsible for any damage caused to a computer using Fiosa, it has occasional hallucinations and sometimes runs random commands*

Fiosa is written in Python, and it uses a technique called Prompt Injection to have a memory of the conversation, and also to give it rules and directives for providing a good experience.
